\label{chap:preliminaries}
% PURPOSE: The purpose of this chapter is to serve as a quick refresher of knowledge that the reader ideally has, or has been exposed to before. This chapter should be to-the-point, and have no superfluous definitions or theorems. Everything should be used later on in the thesis.
% It is important for consistency of the thesis that definitions made here are used throughout the thesis.

% Purpose and content of the chapter
This chapter on preliminaries serves two purposes: (1) to remind the reader of important definitions and theorems, and (2) to establish notation and terminology for the remainder of the thesis.
The reader who is comfortable with basic group theory, category theory and Fourier analysis may skim this chapter.
If the reader is somewhat familiar with the concepts, this chapter will hopefully serve as a quick refresher of knowledge.
%It has been a goal to write a self-contained thesis, so we start with basic definitions. 
Literature references are given in the text.
